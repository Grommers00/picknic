    <h1>About Picknic</h1>
    <p>Who, what, where, when, why, and how, but not in that order...</p>
    <h3>What is Picknic?</h3>
    <p>Picknic is a tool to help you find a fun place to go on a picnic!</p>
    <h3>Who made Picknic?</h3>
    <p>The first prototype of Picknic was made in 24 hours by the following people at a hackathon in early 2016:
      <ul>
        <li>Riley Dawson</li>
        <li>Conner Dunn</li>
        <li>Daniel Phan</li>
        <li>Kent Rasmussen</li>
        <li>Tian Zhi Wang</li>
        <li>Alex Wong</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Additional help was provided by the following people:
      <ul>
        <li>Jason Harris</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>When was the first Pic(k)nic?</h3>
    <p>Picknic came to existence in January, 2016.</p>
    <p>"The first usage of the word (picnic) is traced to the 1692 edition of Tony Willis, Origines de la Langue Fran√ßaise,
      which mentions pique-nique as being of recent origin" -
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic">Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <p>However, "elegant meals outdoors were probably first eaten during the Middle Ages" -
      <a href="http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/history-in-a-basket-its-picnic-time">History.com</a>
      </a>
    </p>
    <h3>Where does the data come from?</h3>
    <p>Most of the data is gathered from open data. For example, the first picnic table data imported in to Picknic was
      <a href="https://data.edmonton.ca/Facilities-and-Structures/Public-Picnic-Table-Locations/vk3s-q842">this dataset from the City of Edmonton</a>.</p>
    <h3>Why does this exist?</h3>
    <p>Picknic exists because picnics with friends, family, and loved ones are fun.</p>
    <h3>How can I help?</h3>
    <p>Anyone can sign up and add a new picnic table they have spotted. Please consider asking your local government to support
      open data, especially geospatial data of assets which the public are free to use.</p>
